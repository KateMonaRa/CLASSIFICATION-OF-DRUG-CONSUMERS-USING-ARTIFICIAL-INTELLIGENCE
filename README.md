# CLASSIFICATION-OF-DRUG-CONSUMERS-USING-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE

Elaine Fehrman collected data on drug consumption in the period from March 2011 to March 2012. The usable sample consisted of 1885 participants. The project looks at 4 essential substances: alcohol, ecstasy, cannabis and nicotine. Binary and multiclass classification are applied to each substance. The following algorithms are then applied to the database to solve the classification problem: multilayer perceptron (MLP), Support Vector method (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Different parameters of each algorithm are implemented and the obtained metrics are observed. The experimental results eventually led to the conclusion that KNN and SVM methods achieve the highest AUC value compared to MLP methods. There are not too large differences in AUC values between the two methods. This result refers to binary classification, as multiclass classification does not contribute to the effective solution of the classification problem. Experimental results on multiclass classification led to the conclusion that the SVM method achieves the highest AUC values.
